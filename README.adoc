== Description

This plugin adds http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle] Support to Jenkins.
http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle] is managed as another tool inside Jenkins (the same way as Ant or Maven), including support for automatic installation and a new build step is provided to execute Gradle tasks.

It also allows detecting https://gradle.com/build-scans/[Build Scans] in arbitrary console logs, for Maven and Gradle builds and display them in the Jenkins UI.

The plugin also allows for injecting Build Scans into both Maven and Gradle builds by setting some environment variables, see link:#_injecting_build_scans[Injecting Build Scans].

In order to release this plugin have a look at link:RELEASING.md[here].

== Configuration

Gradle configuration is performed in the *Configure System* (before Jenkins 2.0) or *Global Tool Configuration* (starting in Jenkins 2.0).
In both cases these options reside in the *Manage Jenkins* section.

In the *Gradle* section provided by this plugin, several installations can be configured:

The system provides both automatic installation, which can be performed by directly downloading from the http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle web site], extracting a compressed final or executing some shell commands.
Besides, for nodes which already has Gradle installed, the tool can be manually configured, by unchecking the *Install automatically* checkbox and providing the base path (`GRADLE_HOME`) of the installation.

== Usage

The Gradle plugin provides an *Invoke Gradle script* build step.

image::gradle-build-step.png[Build step,{thumbnail}]

The first configuration option is whether to use one of the installation configured in Jenkins (see previous section) of use the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper] which is the Gradle-provided mechanism to "embed" the use of a specific Gradle version in a build, installing it if necessary.

Other configuration options include:

* A description to use for the build step.
* Switches (options) to provide to the Gradle execution.
* Tasks to execute (if blank the defaults tasks of the build will be invoked).
* Path to the build script if different from the root directory of the build.
* Name of the build script if different from build.gradle.

If a https://scans.gradle.com/[Gradle Build Scan] is produced during a build, then a link to it is added to the build page.

== Capturing build scans from console log

If you are not using the provided build scan, you can still configure to detect published (Maven or Gradle) https://gradle.com/build-scans/[Build Scans] from the console log.
For doing so, go to *Build Environment* and check *Inspect build log for published Gradle build scans*.

image::inspect-logs-for-build-scans.png[Inspect build log for Build Scan,{thumbnail}]

If build scans are detected in the console log of a build, a badge will be added to the build page.
This works for https://gradle.com/build-scans/[Build Scans] produced by Gradle and Maven builds.

image::jenkins-build-scan.png[Build Scan link,width=60%,align="center"]

== Capturing build scans from Jenkins Pipeline

When using Jenkins pipeline, there is the build step wrapper `withGradle` which can be used to find the build scans emitted by Gradle builds and show them on the build page.
In order to do so, wrap your `sh` or `bat` steps which invoke Gradle into `withGradle`.

For example:
[source]
----
node {
  withGradle {
    sh './gradlew build'
  }
}
----

This causes the shell output to be highlighted and build scan links, which are emitted, are captured.
The captured build scan links are then shown on the build page and in the pipeline steps view.

image::pipeline-steps-scan.png[Build scan in pipeline view,{thumbnail}]

There is also the `findBuildScans()` step, which finds the build scans in the complete log of the pipeline job.
The `withGradle` wrapper should be used instead, since it also deals well with parallel output.

image::find-build-scans.png[Find build scans,{thumbnail}]

== Injecting Build Scans

The plugin can be configured to inject Build Scans into any Gradle or Maven build that's running on the Jenkins server or any of its connected agents.

=== How it works

This feature works by installing scripts and Jars on each agent depending on the environment variable settings.

The feature can be enabled by setting the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_INJECTION` environment variable.

If the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION` environment variable is present, injection is activated for Gradle builds.
This causes an init script to be installed in the user home of each connected agent.
It is required to set `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_URL` environment variable to the URL of the Gradle Enterprise instance to which to publish the Build Scan.

The init script is removed when `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION` is unset, thus deactivating injection for Gradle builds.

If the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_EXTENSION_VERSION` environment variable is present, injection is activated for Maven builds.
This causes the Gradle Enterprise Maven Extension to be installed on each connected agent, and the `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable will be modified so that each Maven process will load the extension.

The extension is deleted from all agents and the changes to `MAVEN_OPTS` are reverted when `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_EXTENSION_VERSION` is unset.

=== Configuration options

The following table lists all available configuration options.

.General variables
|===
|Environment variable|Build Tool|Description

|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_INJECTION|Both|Enable the feature if set.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_URL|Both|The URL of the Gradle Enterprise server to publish Build Scans to.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_SERVER|Both|Whether to allow publishing to a server with a self-signed certificate. Defaults to `false`.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_PLUGIN_REPOSITORY_URL|Gradle|The URL of the repository to use when resolving the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin and the Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin. Required if Jenkins agents are not able to access the Gradle Plugin Portal at https://plugins.gradle.org.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION|Gradle|Enables injection for Gradle builds and defines which version of the https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.enterprise[Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin] to use.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_CCUD_PLUGIN_VERSION|Gradle|Defines which version of the https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin[Common Custom User Data Gradle Plugin] to use.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_INJECTION_ENABLED_NODES|Gradle|Comma separated list of node labels where the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin injection should be enabled. By default, all nodes are enabled.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_INJECTION_DISABLED_NODES|Gradle|Comma separated list of node labels where the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin injection should be disabled. By default, all nodes are enabled.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_EXTENSION_VERSION|Maven|Enables injection for Maven builds and defines which version of the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension[Gradle Enterprise Maven extension] to use.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_CCUD_EXTENSION_VERSION|Maven|Defines which version of the https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension[Common Custom User Data Maven Extension] to use.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_MAVEN_INJECTION_ENABLED_NODES|Maven|Comma separated list of node labels where the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension injection should be enabled. By default, all nodes are enabled.
|JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_MAVEN_INJECTION_DISABLED_NODES|Maven|Comma separated list of node labels where the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension injection should be disabled. By default, all nodes are enabled.
|===

In addition to the variables above you might want to set the `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY` variable if you're Gradle Enterprise server requires authentication for publishing Build Scans. Refer to the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#via_environment_variable[Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin manual] and the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/#via_environment_variable[Gradle Enterprise Maven Extension manual] for more information.

=== Limitations

- The configuration is based on global environment variables and applies to all builds on the server and all connected agents.
- Injecting Build Scans into Maven builds only works if `MAVEN_OPTS` is not set.
- Values of `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_EXTENSION_VERSION` and `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_CCUD_EXTENSION_VERSION` environment variables are ignored at the moment.
These variables are only used as triggers for the injection of the corresponding extensions.
