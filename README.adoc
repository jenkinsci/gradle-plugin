== Description

This plugin adds http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle] Support to Jenkins.
http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle] is managed as another tool inside Jenkins (the same way as Ant or Maven), including support for automatic installation and a new build step is provided to execute Gradle tasks.

It also allows detecting https://gradle.com/build-scans/[Build Scans] in arbitrary console logs, for Maven and Gradle builds and display them in the Jenkins UI.

You can have the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/[Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin] and the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/[Gradle Enterprise Maven extension] automatically injected into your Gradle and Maven builds.
See <<Gradle Enterprise integration>> for more details.

== Configuration

Gradle configuration is performed in the *Configure System* (before Jenkins 2.0) or *Global Tool Configuration* (starting in Jenkins 2.0).
In both cases these options reside in the *Manage Jenkins* section.

In the *Gradle* section provided by this plugin, several installations can be configured:

The system provides both automatic installation, which can be performed by directly downloading a Gradle distribution from the http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle web site] or executing some shell commands to achieve the same.
Besides, for nodes which already have Gradle installed, the tool can be manually configured, by unchecking the *Install automatically* checkbox and providing the base path (as a `GRADLE_HOME` environment variable) of the installation.

== Usage

The Gradle plugin provides an *Invoke Gradle script* build step.

image::gradle-build-step.png[Build step,{thumbnail}]

The first configuration option is whether to use one of the installation configured in Jenkins (see previous section) of use the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper] which is the Gradle-provided mechanism to "embed" the use of a specific Gradle version in a build, installing it if necessary.

Other configuration options include:

* A description to use for the build step.
* Switches (options) to provide to the Gradle execution.
* Tasks to execute (if blank the defaults tasks of the build will be invoked).
* Path to the build script if different from the root directory of the build.
* Name of the build script if different from `build.gradle`.

If a https://gradle.com/build-scans/[Gradle Build Scan] is produced during a build, then a link to it is added to the build page.

== Capturing build scans from the console log

If you are not using the Gradle build step described above, or have a Maven build, you can configure to detect published https://gradle.com/build-scans/[build scans] from the console log.
For doing so, go to *Build Environment* and check *Inspect build log for published build scans*.

image::inspect-logs-for-build-scans.png[Inspect build log for Build Scan,{thumbnail}]

If build scans are detected in the console log of a build, a badge will be added to the build page.
This works for https://gradle.com/build-scans/[build scans] produced by Gradle and Maven builds.

image::jenkins-build-scan.png[Build Scan link,width=60%,align="center"]

== Capturing build scans from Jenkins Pipeline

When using Jenkins pipeline, there is the build step wrapper `withGradle` which can be used to find the build scans emitted by Gradle or Maven builds and show them on the build page.
In order to do so, wrap your `sh` or `bat` steps which invoke Gradle or Maven into `withGradle`.

For example:
[source]

----
node {
  withGradle {
    sh './gradlew build'
  }
}
----

This causes the shell output to be highlighted and build scan links, which are published, are captured.
The captured build scan links are then shown on the build page and in the pipeline steps view.

image::pipeline-steps-scan.png[Build scan in pipeline view,{thumbnail}]

There is also the `findBuildScans()` step, which finds the build scans in the complete log of the pipeline job.
The `withGradle` wrapper should be used instead, since it also deals well with parallel output.

== Gradle Enterprise integration

The plugin can be configured to inject the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/[Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin] or the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/[Gradle Enterprise Maven extension] into any Gradle or Maven build that is executed on the Jenkins server or on any of its connected agents.
To achieve this, the plugin installs various files on each agent depending on the configuration via the given environment variables.

The same auto-injection behavior is available for the https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin[Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin] and the https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension[Common Custom User Data Maven extension].

> **Note**
> - The configuration is based on global environment variables and applies to all builds on all connected agents matching the specified label criteria, or all in case no label criteria are defined.

=== Enable auto-injection

The auto-injection is split into three levels to have fine-grained control over the enablement of this feature.

==== Global

To globally enable the auto-injection set the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_INJECTION` environment variable to `true`.
Next set the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_URL` environment variable to the URL of the Gradle Enterprise instance.

==== Gradle

To enable the auto-injection for Gradle builds, set the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION` environment variable to the desired https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/[Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin] version to be used.

Optionally set the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_CCUD_PLUGIN_VERSION` environment variable to the desired version of the https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin[Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin] to be used.

==== Maven

To enable the auto-injection for Maven builds, set the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_EXTENSION_VERSION` environment variable to any value to enable the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/[Gradle Enterprise Maven extension] injection.

Optionally set the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_CCUD_EXTENSION_VERSION` to any value to enable https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension[Common Custom User Data Maven extension] injection.

Currently, the values of these environment variables are ignored and are just used as a trigger to enable the auto-injection.
This may change in a future version of the plugin.
To see which version is injected, see <<Compatibility>>.

> **Warning**
> - Maven injection only works if `MAVEN_OPTS` is not configured as a global environment variable.

=== Disable auto-injection

Disabling the auto-injection requires that all Gradle Enterprise resources are cleaned up from the agents.
To achieve this, the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_INJECTION` environment variable must be set to `true` and the Gradle or Maven injections must be disabled individually.
This triggers a cleanup of the resources.
If the auto-injection should be disabled globally, then remove the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_INJECTION` as well.

==== Gradle

To disable the auto-injection for Gradle builds, remove the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION` environment variable.

==== Maven

To disable the auto-injection for Maven builds, remove the `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_EXTENSION_VERSION` environment variable.

=== Configuration options

The following sections list all available configuration options which can be set as environment variables.

==== General environment variables

Defaults to `false`.

`GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY` +
If your Gradle Enterprise server requires authentication for publishing build scans you might want to set the `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable.
Refer to the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#via_environment_variable[Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin manual] and the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/#via_environment_variable[Gradle Enterprise Maven Extension manual] for more details about this configuration.

`JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_CCUD_EXTENSION_VERSION` +
Defines which version of the https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension[Common Custom User Data Maven Extension] to use. Currently, the value of this environment variable is ignored and is just used as a trigger to enable the auto-injection.
