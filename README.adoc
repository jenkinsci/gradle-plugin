== Description

This plugin adds http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle] Support to Jenkins.
http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle] is managed as another tool inside Jenkins (the same way as Ant or Maven), including support for automatic installation and a new build step is provided to execute Gradle tasks.

It also allows detecting https://gradle.com/build-scans/[Build Scans] in arbitrary console logs, for Maven and Gradle builds and display them in the Jenkins UI.

You can have the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/[Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin] and the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/[Gradle Enterprise Maven extension] automatically injected into your Gradle and Maven builds.
See <<Gradle Enterprise integration>> for more details.

== Configuration

Gradle configuration is performed in the *Configure System* (before Jenkins 2.0) or *Global Tool Configuration* (starting in Jenkins 2.0).
In both cases these options reside in the *Manage Jenkins* section.

In the *Gradle* section provided by this plugin, several installations can be configured:

image::gradle-tool-installation.png[Tool installations,{thumbnail}]

The system provides both automatic installation, which can be performed by directly downloading a Gradle distribution from the http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle website] or executing some shell commands to achieve the same.
Besides, for nodes which already have Gradle installed, the tool can be manually configured, by unchecking the *Install automatically* checkbox and providing the base path (as a `GRADLE_HOME` environment variable) of the installation.

== Usage

The Gradle plugin provides an *Invoke Gradle script* build step.

image::gradle-build-step.png[Build step,{thumbnail}]

The first configuration option is whether to use one of the installation configured in Jenkins (see previous section) of use the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper] which is the Gradle-provided mechanism to "embed" the use of a specific Gradle version in a build, installing it if necessary.

Other configuration options include:

* A description to use for the build step.
* Switches (options) to provide to the Gradle execution.
* Tasks to execute (if blank the defaults tasks of the build will be invoked).
* Path to the build script if different from the root directory of the build.
* Name of the build script if different from `build.gradle`.

If a https://gradle.com/build-scans/[Gradle Build Scan] is produced during a build, then a link to it is added to the build page.

image::jenkins-build-scan.png[Build Scan link,width=60%,align="center"]

== Capturing build scans from the console log

If you are not using the Gradle build step described above, or have a Maven build, you can configure to detect published https://gradle.com/build-scans/[build scans] from the console log.
For doing so, go to *Build Environment* and check *Inspect build log for published build scans*.

image::inspect-logs-for-build-scans.png[Inspect build log for Build Scan,{thumbnail}]

If build scans are detected in the console log of a build, a badge will be added to the build page.
This works for https://gradle.com/build-scans/[build scans] produced by Gradle and Maven builds.

image::jenkins-build-scan.png[Build Scan link,width=60%,align="center"]

== Capturing build scans from Jenkins Pipeline

When using Jenkins pipeline, there is the build step wrapper `withGradle` which can be used to find the build scans emitted by Gradle or Maven builds and show them on the build page.
In order to do so, wrap your `sh` or `bat` steps which invoke Gradle or Maven into `withGradle`.

For example:
[source]

----
node {
  withGradle {
    sh './gradlew build'
  }
}
----

This causes the shell output to be highlighted and build scan links, which are published, are captured.
The captured build scan links are then shown on the build page and in the pipeline steps view.

image::pipeline-steps-scan.png[Build scan in pipeline view,{thumbnail}]

There is also the `findBuildScans()` step, which finds the build scans in the complete log of the pipeline job.
The `withGradle` wrapper should be used instead, since it also deals well with parallel output.

image::find-build-scans.png[Find build scans,{thumbnail}]

== Enriched build scans

Build scans links on the Job summary page can be enriched with data fetched from the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/api-manual/[Gradle Enterprise server API].
If enabled, the project name, requested tasks, build tool version, build outcome and build scan links will be provided.
This feature is available for both Gradle and Maven builds and compatible with auto-injection documented below.

image::enriched-build-scans.png[Enriched build scans,{thumbnail}]

> **Note**
> - Build scans published on the public instance (https://scans.gradle.com) are not eligible.

> **Note**
> - Enabling this feature will trigger 2 HTTP requests to the Gradle Enterprise server per build scan published.

=== Enriched build scans configuration

The configuration of the feature can be done in the Jenkins global system configuration.

The feature can be enabled or disabled (default).

If anonymous access to the API is not allowed, an access key has to be provided.

HTTP client settings can also be customized.

image::enriched-build-scans-configuration.png[Enriched build scans configuration,{thumbnail}]

== Gradle Enterprise integration

The plugin can be configured to inject the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/[Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin] or the https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/[Gradle Enterprise Maven extension] into any Gradle or Maven build that is executed on the Jenkins server or on any of its connected agents.
To achieve this, the plugin installs various files on each agent depending on the configuration via the global options in the `Manage Jenkins/Configure System` section.

The same auto-injection behavior is available for the https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin[Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin] and the https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension[Common Custom User Data Maven extension].

> **Note**
> - The configuration applies to all builds on all connected agents matching the specified label criteria, or all in case no label criteria are defined.

=== Enable auto-injection

The auto-injection is split into several levels to have fine-grained control over the enablement of this feature.

==== Global

To globally enable the auto-injection, click the `Enable auto-injection` checkbox in the `Gradle Enterprise integration` section of the global options in the `Manage Jenkins/Configure System` section.
Next set the URL of the Gradle Enterprise instance to which the build scans should be published to.

image::enable-auto-injection.png[Enable auto-injection,{thumbnail}]

Optionally you can click the `Enforce Gradle Enterprise server url` checkbox to enforce the configured Gradle Enterprise URL over a URL configured in the project's build (only applies to Gradle projects).

===== VCS repository filtering (Beta)

It is also possible to enable/disable injection for specific repositories by specifying VCS repository filters. These are _Newline-delimited_ set of rules in the form of `+|-:repository_matching_keyword`, which will be used in a contains check against the repository URL.

image::general-vcs-repository-filters.png[Git VCS repository filters, {thumbnail}]

Consider the following examples:
[source]

----
+:foo
----
The injection will only be performed for Git repository URLs which contain `foo`.
[source]

----
-:foo
----
The injection will not be performed for Git repository URLs which contain `foo`, but will be for all others.
[source]

----
+:foo
-:foobar
----
The injection will be performed for Git repository URLs which contain `foo`, but not the ones containing `foobar`.

The exclusion patterns take precedence over the inclusion patterns.

> **Note**
> - This feature is currently in Beta and requires Git Plugin to be installed. If Git Plugin is not installed, the following warning message will be show instead. The feature supports both Gradle and Maven builds (FreeStyle and Pipeline job configurations)

image::general-git-plugin-not-installed.png[Git Plugin is not installed, {thumbnail}]

==== Gradle

To enable the auto-injection for Gradle builds, set the desired https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/[Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin] version in the `Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin version` field in the `Gradle settings` section of the configuration form.

image::gradle-settings.png[Gradle settings,{thumbnail}]

Optionally set the desired version of the https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin[Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin] to be used.

==== Maven

To enable the auto-injection for Maven builds, click the `Enable Gradle Enterprise Maven extension auto-injection` checkbox in the `Maven settings` section of the configuration form.

image::maven-settings.png[Maven settings,{thumbnail}]

Optionally click the `Enable Common Custom User Data Maven extension auto-injection` checkbox to enable the auto-injection of the https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension[Common Custom User Data Maven Extension].

To see which versions are injected, refer to <<Auto-injection compatibility>>.

> **Warning**
> - Maven injection only works if `MAVEN_OPTS` is not configured as a global environment variable.

=== Disable auto-injection

Disabling the auto-injection requires that all Gradle Enterprise resources are cleaned up from the agents.
To achieve this, the Gradle or Maven injections must be disabled individually (see the following sections).
This triggers a cleanup of the resources.
If the auto-injection should be disabled globally, then uncheck the `Enable auto-injection` checkbox as well.

==== Gradle

To disable the auto-injection for Gradle builds, remove the `Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin version` in the `Gradle settings` section of the configuration form.

==== Maven

To disable the auto-injection for Maven builds, uncheck the `Enable Gradle Enterprise Maven extension auto-injection` checkbox in the `Maven settings` section of the configuration form.

=== Control auto-injection based on node labels

Auto-injection can be enabled or disabled based on specific node labels.
To enable auto-injection only on specific nodes, add the desired labels to the `Gradle auto-injection enabled nodes` list for Gradle or `Maven auto-injection enabled nodes` for Maven.
To disable auto-injection on specific nodes, add the desired labels to the `Gradle auto-injection disabled nodes` list for Gradle or `Maven auto-injection disabled nodes` for Maven.

The disabled labels list will take precedence over the enabled labels list.

=== Configuration options

=== Auto-injection compatibility
The following sections list the compatibility of the plugin with the Gradle Enterprise version based on the given build tool in use.

==== For Gradle builds
For Gradle builds the version used for the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin is defined in the `Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin version` field in the `Gradle settings` section of the configuration form.
See <<Enable auto-injection>> for details.
The compatibility of the specified version with Gradle Enterprise can be found https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/compatibility/#gradle_enterprise_gradle_plugin[here].

For the optional Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin which is defined the same form, you can see the compatibility of the specified version with the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin#version-compatibility[here].

==== For Maven builds
For Maven builds the version of the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension is bundled into the plugin, meaning that the user can’t change what version is injected into the Maven build.

The following table shows the compatibility of the plugin version with Gradle Enterprise:

|===
|Jenkins Gradle Plugin version  | Injected Gradle Enterprise Maven extension version | Injected Common Custom User Data Maven extension version  | Minimum supported Gradle Enterprise version
|Next version                   | 1.19                                               | 1.12.3                                                    | 2023.2

== Disabling/uninstalling Gradle Jenkins plugin

To ensure that all Gradle Enterprise resources are cleaned up from the agents, before disabling/uninstalling the plugin the auto-injection has to be manually disabled. Please, refer to the <<Disable auto-injection>> section for details.

== Upgrade notes

=== 2.0

> **Note**
> - These upgrade notes only apply if you configured the Gradle Enterprise auto-injection feature.

A new form based configuration was introduced in this version, which replaces the configuration via environment variables. There is no automatic migration, therefore you need to manually migrate the already configured auto-injection via environment variables you'd need to follow these steps:

1. Copy the values of the following environment variables and then remove them in the global configuration following environment variables from the global configuration:
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_INJECTION`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_URL`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_SERVER`
- `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_CCUD_PLUGIN_VERSION`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_PLUGIN_REPOSITORY_URL`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_INJECTION_ENABLED_NODES`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_INJECTION_DISABLED_NODES`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_EXTENSION_VERSION`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_CCUD_EXTENSION_VERSION`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_MAVEN_INJECTION_ENABLED_NODES`
- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_MAVEN_INJECTION_DISABLED_NODES`
2. Copy the previously saved values and enter them in the new form based configuration to have the same configuration as before.
