<div>
    Comma-separated list of VCS repository patterns for which to enable Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin/Maven extension auto-injection.
    By default, all VCS repositories have auto-injection enabled. If specified, the auto-injection will only apply to the ones which contain said patterns.
    Disabled nodes have precedence over this filtering. This feature is currently in Beta and can be changed in future releases.
