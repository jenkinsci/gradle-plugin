Prepares build environment to call gradle with an <code>bat</code> or <code>sh</code> step.
More formally: Sets the GRADLE_HOME environment variable pointing to the selected Gradle Installation and
adds the value to the PATH environment variable, so that in the block argument could simpley look like this:
<pre>
node {
    dir('gradleProject') {
        withGradle(gradleName: 'gradle-4.10.2', jdkName: 'JDK-1.8.0.144') {
            bat 'gradle build'
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Additionally the console output will be parsed and executed tasks are linked as in default gradle plugin.
