    By default, the Gradle plugin tries to locate the wrapper executable (gradlew on Unix and gradlew.exe on Windows)
    next to the build script. If it
    is not there it will look in the workspace root.
    If your workspace has the wrapper somewhere else, specify the path
    to the directory (relative to workspace) containing the wrapper executable here,
    such as parent instead of just ${workspace}/parent.
